Recently I get a requirement to record the everyday car pool fees and make the payment at the end of the week. It only needs to add the sum with a fixed fees with one trigger and clear the sum with another trigger after making the payment. After searching for a while, a simple budget with Shortcuts and Numbers is chosen from [用Shortcuts+Numbers做一个便捷记账程序 | Jo Cruise](https://jo-cruise.github.io/posts/MoneyTrackerShortcuts/). Run the Shortcuts, select an item from the pop-up menu, and add an amount, then the record will be added in the Numbers file, which could be synced across Apple devices through the iCloud.


After importing the [Simple Budget Shortcuts](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0050d99967e74965bc187b8aafb4b600) and downloading the ![[Simple Budget Numbers Template En.nmbtemplate]], configure the Shortcuts by selecting the Numbers file.

> The Numbers template is used for the English OS. Change the month name of each sheet to others for other language OSes. 

Put the Shortcuts to the Home Screen for easier access. Try to add a record by run the Shortcuts, and the record will soon come up in the Numbers file.

The car pool and payment are not provided in the transport category. It is free to add them as customized ones. 

Therefore, this solution, with the Shortcuts and Numbers from Apple's free Apps, would record the car pool fees, payments and more with a few taps.
